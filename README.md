# About the script 
goes over the groceries list, searches the products and adds the first result of the search to the cart.
this is a work in progress, many new features can be added and the current mechanism is'nt so good.
currently when running the script, you have to actively exit the pop up window at the first search, and then hit enter in the python console.
after the script finishes it waits for the user to hit enter in the console to close the window.
